# itta

itta is a fashion-tech platform that connects Customers with Fashioneers (tailors/designers). This repository currently contains the frontend scaffolding only; backend integration will follow.

## Roles

- Customer: stores personal measurements and requests outfits.
- Fashioneer: posts design concepts and accepts sewing jobs.

## Core idea

Customers can keep measurements on file and request outfits, while Fashioneers can publish designs and take on sewing work.

## Tech stack

- Quasar + Vue 3
- Composition API with `<script setup>`
- Pinia for state management
- Mobile-first approach

## Run locally

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Start the dev server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
